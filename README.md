# Excel-Parental-Leave-Analysis

## Introduction

Insights regarding parental leave pique the interest of three distinct groups: the Government, job seekers, and employees and employers.
* The government needs to know how many weeks of parental leave a company offers to ensure that all parents have access to this important benefit, promote gender equality in the workforce, and improve the health and well-being of children.
* A job seeker or employee needs to have insights about the number of parental leave a company gives to make sure that the company is a good fit for their family's needs, to negotiate for better parental leave benefits, and to make an informed decision about whether or not to take parental leave
* Firms need to have insights about the number of weeks of parental leave they offer to attract and retain top talent, comply with government regulations, improve their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) profile, and reduce turnover.

According to ILO standards, there is a requirement for a minimum maternity leave period of 14 weeks, with a recommendation to extend it to at least 18 weeks. This extension is suggested to give the mother sufficient time for rest and recovery after childbirth.https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_838655.pdf
